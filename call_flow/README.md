# Call Flow Progress 

## Objective
I wanted to build a simple browser-based application that a health care customer service representative could use to track their progress through a benefit quote on a phone call.

## Steps Taken
I used the Bootstrap 4 framework for the heading and list items, then a progress bar from W3 schools. In order to have the different list items change color when clicked, I had to write my own JavaScript file. Once I was able to get the list items to change colors, I also built an event listener and an additional JavaScript function to change the style of the progress bar and it's text as the list items are clicked by the user.

## Results
The final application is very basic, and has some trouble running in internet explorer. I was able to get it running in Chrome, so for the time being this is where I will direct users. Future improvements might include wider browser support and cleaner styling, but this app meets the basic requirements and is ready for use as is.
  
*Note: For best functionality, please run this application in Google Chrome.*
