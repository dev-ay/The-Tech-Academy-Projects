# Call Flow Progress 

## Objective
I wanted to build a simple browser-based application that a health care customer service representative could use to track their progress through a benefit quote on a phone call.

## Steps Taken
I used the Bootstrap 4 framework for the heading and list items, then a progress bar from W3 schools. In order to have the different list items change color when clicked, I had to write my own JavaScript file. Once I was able to get the list items to change colors, I also built an event listener and an additional JavaScript function to change the style of the progress bar and it's text as the list items are clicked by the user.
  
After doing some user testing, there was a request to add an 8th list item. I added this list item and updated the program for all users. Another request was submitted to make a version of the application that uses check boxes so that users could go in their own order instead of just sequentially. This update has been completed in a separate "checks.html" file so that both versions are available. I had to re-write my JavaScript file as well to accommodate the new user input, this is stored as script2.js. I am especially proud of how responsive the new scripting is, updating the progress bar actively while the user is checking and/or unchecking boxes.

## Results
The final application is very basic, and has some trouble running in internet explorer. I was able to get it running in Chrome and Edge, so for the time being this is where I will direct users. Future improvements might include wider browser support and cleaner styling. Currently both the check-box version and the list item version meet the project requirements are fully functioning.
  
*Note: For best functionality, please run this application in Google Chrome. You can view a live version hosted on my pCloud [here](https://filedn.com/lWYjvlpRciYBP9xzzyqgShB/call_flow/index.html).*
