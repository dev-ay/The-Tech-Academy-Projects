# Red Fox University

This is a code-first, MVC.NET application built in C# that I completed in preparation for my Live Project course at The Tech Academy in 2018. It uses the entity framework and implements full CRUD functionality for a pretend University student roster. It also uses binding to prevent several security vulnerabilities such as over-posting.

## Challenges
While working on this project, I ran into a Visual Studio bug where my old build loaded every time I ran the project (even though the files had been changed.) After some troubleshooting, I recreated a portion of the solution again on a different system and everything started to run smoothly again. It's unclear if this bug is in relation to my system configuration or just a problem with VS2015 that was fixed in VS2017.
  
The reason working through this challenge was helpful is that it required me to really dig back through my code and understand what each part of the application was doing to make sure I hadn't made an error somewhere. I like to assume first that a problem in a project has to do with an error on my part before I assume it's a problem with Visual Studio, and I don't plan on changing the order of problem solving I've been using as a result of this one instance.
