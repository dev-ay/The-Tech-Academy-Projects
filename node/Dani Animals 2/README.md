# Basic Server UI

## Overview
This is a basic server UI webpage created using node.js, express, jade, and mongodb.

## Steps Taken
This is my first project created from a basic express framework. In order to access the database in a reliable fashion, I used mLab and tapped into the database in the app.js file using monk. This took a little bit of troubleshooting as I imagine most connections do when created from scratch.

## Outcome
On principle, I do not post projects on my GitHub that simply involve following a tutorial because they don't show any of my coding approach or thought process. There *are* some projects here that are based on a coding challenge or a tutorial, but I will always do my best to call those out.
  
In this case, I am working up to my first, decent-looking full stack application built with a JavaScript (node.js, express.js, mongodb.) I used techniques in this app from the first few node.js projects I have worked on during my studies. The front end is very basic, but I am really proud of the way this app routs the user through the different pages and that it can communicate with a database. For me, this was one of the largest mental hurdles of learning software development thus far and I'm really looking forward to taking things up a notch now and adding additional functionality in my next project.
