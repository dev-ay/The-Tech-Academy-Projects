# Basic Server UI

## Overview
This is a basic server UI created using node.js, express, mongodb and monk.

## Steps Taken
This is my first project created from a basic express framework. In order to access the database in a reliable fashion, I used mLab and tapped into the database in the app.js file using monk. This took a little bit of troubleshooting as I imagine most connections do when created from scratch.
  
Currently, the app can only read from the database, but next I will build out a write functionality as well!
