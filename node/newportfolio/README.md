# New Portfolio

## Objective
Create a Node.js app using Express to serve dynamic content to a website.

## Steps Taken
Earlier in my TTA coursework I created a static HTML portfolio, knowing I would likely come back and improve it some time in the future. I started with much of the raw content from the HTML app and built a basic Node.js app using Express that starts by serving the same content. In this project, I am learning a new templating language and doing all my views as .ejs instead of Jade. This is also my first project built with the new bootstrap 4.x--previously I used v4 Alpha 6.

After getting the static layout in place, I will start to add some content dynamically using javascript in my view file, as well as pull some data from a data JSON object to create "more details" pages for some of the elements on my home page.

## Outcome
This app is still under construction!
