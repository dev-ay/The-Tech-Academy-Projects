# Node.js

After completing the Microsoft development courses at The Tech Academy in 2018, I had handful of weeks before I was scheduled to start my live project. I took advantage of this lull in course material to do some in-depth self-study of some of the JavaScript frameworks being used in modern open source development. 
  
Though it is not technically part of the TTA boot camp content, I am storing these projects here for the time being because I think they still represent an important chapter in my path to learning full stack software development. 

## Projects in this Repository:
* [Chat App](https://github.com/jhunschejones/The-Tech-Academy-Projects/tree/master/node/Chat%20App) (mongodb, express and socket.io)
* [“Full Stack” App](https://github.com/jhunschejones/The-Tech-Academy-Projects/tree/master/node/Dani%20Animals%202) (node.js, express, jade, and mongodb)
