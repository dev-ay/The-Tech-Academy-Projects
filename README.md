# The Tech Academy Portfolio
## Overview
I am a current student at The Tech Academy, a software development boot camp and licensed career school in downtown Portland, Oregon. As a part of this program I will be working on several small projects to build my skills in HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, C#, and the .NET framework. I will also create some larger projects as well, and some of these you will find in their own repositories (especially if I am planning to build them out further.) The repository you are currently in is for my smaller practice projects that may or may not be fleshed out into full applications later. Thank you for taking the time to look through this code! I am always trying my hardest to grow and improve my skills and I welcome any and all feedback you may have. You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhunschejones), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhunschejones), or by [email](mailto:contact@joshuahunschejones.com).
